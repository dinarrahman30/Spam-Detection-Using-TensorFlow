# SMS Spam Detection using TensorFlow in Python

Just like email, messaging is one of the message exchange features on mobile phones. But the important point is that most of the messages received are spam, and only a few are ham or necessary communications. Scammers create fake text messages to trick you into giving away your personal information, such as passwords, account numbers, or Social Security numbers. If they have that information, they may be able to gain access to your email, bank, or other accounts.

In this article, we will develop various deep learning models using Tensorflow to detect SMS spam and also analyze the performance metrics of various models.
